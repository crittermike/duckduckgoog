    h2 Set your default browser search!
    hr
    h3 Chrome
    p
      strong Without Search Suggestions
    p Just by visiting the site, Chrome should have already stored it as a search engine. Just go to Chrome's search engine settings and find duckduckgoog.com in that list, then click "Make Default" next to it.
    p
      strong With Search Suggestions
    p Unfortunately Chrome can't auto-discover more than one search per site, so if you want to use search suggestions, click 
      a(href='#', onclick='window.external.AddSearchProvider("http://duckduckgoog.com/opensearchsuggest.xml");') this link
      | . Note that after doing so you'll probably want to go into Chrome's search engine options to set it as the default search by clicking "Make Default" next to it.
    hr

    h3 Firefox
    p 
      strong Search Bar
    p Click the little dropdown arrow in the Firefox search bar, then click "Add DuckDuckGoog" to save it--note that you can choose to use search suggestions or not. You might have to click it again to make it your default.
    p
      strong Awesomebar
    p Visit 
      a(href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Location_Bar_search#Location_Bar_search_.28external_-_search_engine.29") this page with instructions
      |  and use the following URL as the search string (or see below if you want to use a localized Google URL): 
    code http://www.duckduckgoog.com?q=
    br
    br
    hr

    h3 Other Browsers & Launchers 
    p DuckDuckGoog should be easy to add to any browser or launcher (Alfred, GnomeDo, etc.) that supports custom searches. 
    p Just use this search string in your browser/launcher's search engine options to create a custom search: 
    code http://www.duckduckgoog.com?q=SEARCH
    p (Replace SEARCH with whatever your browser/launcher expects the placeholder to be).

    hr
    h3 Using a different (localized) Google URL
    p If you would rather make DuckDuckGoog search google.com.au or google.co.jp etc., than the default encrypted.google.com, then just include that in your search URL, using something like 
    code http://www.duckduckgoog.com?q=searchstring&google=custom-google-url.com
    p For example, if you use Chrome and want to default your Google search to Google Japan, use this:
    code http://www.duckduckgoog.com?q=%s&google=google.co.jp
    p Note that if you use Firefox, you don't have the option to manually change search engine URLs like that, so you'll need to install an addon of something like 
      a(href='http://mycroft.mozdev.org/index.html') Mycroft
      |  that allows you to do this.

    hr
    h3 Using a custom search engine
    p If you would like to use another search engine other than google (Like Bing or Yahoo), simply put the url and a 
      code  %s
      |  where the search goes, like so:
    code http://www.duckduckgoog.com?q=searchstring&searchengine=http://searchengine.com?query=%s
    p For example, if you use Chrome and want to default your search to Yahoo, use this:
    code http://www.duckduckgoog.com?q=%s&searchengine=http://yahoo.com?q=%s
    p Make sure to put the 
      code  http:// 
      |  or the 
      code  https://
      |  before the URL.
    p Also be aware that DuckDuckGoog will default to google.com if there is an error in the syntax.
